## Installation
To get this project up and running you should start by installing Python on your computer. I would suggest that you create a virtual environment to store your project's dependencies separately. You can install virtualenv with

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
Clone this repository then go to the project directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/orozbekov/kivy-currency-converter.git
cd kivy-currency-converter
```
In a terminal (mac/Linux) run the following command in the base directory of this project to create a virtual environment.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
That will create a new folder `.venv` in your project directory. Next activate it with this command on mac/Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
Then install the project dependencies with this command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now you can run the project with this command:
```bash
python main.py
```
